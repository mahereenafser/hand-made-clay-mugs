          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Founded in 2016, Clay & Co. began as a passion project in my tiny Brooklyn apartment. What started as a creative outlet after long days in corporate marketing has grown into a full-time pottery studio and community hub.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            With a BFA in Ceramics from Parsons and years of experience in various clay techniques, I specialize in functional pottery that brings joy to everyday moments. Every piece that leaves our studio is crafted with intention and care.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600">
            When I'm not at the wheel, you can find me exploring NYC's incredible food scene, searching for inspiration in museums, or teaching pottery workshops to spread the love of handmade ceramics.

          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            We believe that everyday objects should be beautiful, functional, and made with care. In our fast-paced world, there's something special about slowing down with a handmade mug, feeling its unique texture, and knowing it was created by human hands.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Sustainability is at the heart of what we do. We source our clay locally when possible, use non-toxic glazes, and create pieces designed to last for generations. Each mug is not just a vessel for your favorite beverageâ€”it's a small act of resistance against disposable culture.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600">
            Our studio is more than a workspace; it's a community. Through workshops, markets, and collaborations with local businesses, we're building connections and celebrating the value of handmade goods in New York City.
